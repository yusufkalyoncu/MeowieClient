# MeowieClient
Meowie Client is a movie review web application where users can review and rate movies they've watched. They can also create lists of movies they want to watch and share them with others. Users can follow their favorite users and track their movie lists.
This client is using MeowieAPI.
During development, I used React JS, tailwind, and context API. 
The application is still in development.
